    My name is Chris Donnelly and I am a junior at Menlo School in Atherton, California. <br>
    I am passionate about writing, data science, and the ways in which they can be combined. <br>
    I first started programming in first and second grade when my sibling introduced me <br>
    to the Scratch programming language. Since then, I've used web development tools to edit <br>
    an educational tech resource for students in Nepal and data science techniques to engage <br>
    in astronomy research. I am also interested in writing and poetry in particular. <br>
    In my free time, I like to spend time with my family, listen to music, run, and watch Netflix <br>
